# Software Sustainability Institute website

Anyone can log issues or things they'd like to see added to the Software Sustainability Institute website.

**Please do not use the issue tracker for general queries about the Institute, or non-website issues. If in doubt, email info@software.ac.uk**

## Open a new issue for each bug or feature request

But please search the issues first to see if someone else has already reported it - if so, add a comment with your experience to the existing issue.

## Write a clear title for the issue

How would you describe the issue using about 10 words? 

A good summary should quickly and uniquely identify the issue, and explain the problem rather than your suggested solution,

For example:

Good: "Scrolling doesn't work in text entry box on Events webpage"
Bad: "Website doesn't work"

## Give us enough information to be able to reproduce the issue

It would help us a lot if you told us:
  * The URL of the webpage that is causing the problem
  * What web browser (and version number) and which operating system you're using

## Give us enough information to plan a new feature

It would help us a lot if you told us:
  * Which part of the website you're proposing be changed
  * Why the addition or change to the website would help you
  
Thanks for contributing to making our website better!
